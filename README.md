# Zombie Apocalypse

## Overview

After the nuclear war, a strange and deadly virus has infected the planet producing mindless
zombies. These zombies now wander the world converting any remaining living creatures they find to zombies as well.

The world is represented by an *n* x *n* grid on which **zombies** and **creatures** live.
The location of zombies and creatures can be addressed using zero-indexed *x-y* coordinates.
The top left corner of the world is *(x: 0, y: 0)*. The horizontal coordinate is represented by *x*,
and the vertical coordinate is represented by *y*.

At the beginning of the program, a single zombie awakes and begins to move around the grid following a sequence of movements.
Valid movements are **U**p, **D**own, **L**eft, **R**ight. The movement sequence is represented by a string of single
character movements, e.g. *RDRU* (**R**ight, **D**own, **R**ight, **Up**).

Zombies can move through the edge of the grid, appearing on the directly opposite side.
For a 10x10 grid, a zombie moving left from (0, 4) will move to (9, 4); a zombie moving down from (3, 9) will move to (3, 0).

Each time a zombie takes a step, the new location should be logged, eg:

*zombie 0 moved to (2,3)*.

If a zombie occupies the same square as a creature, the creature is transformed into another zombie.

Each time a zombie infects a creature this should be logged, eg:

*zombie 0 infected creature at (3,3)*.

The creatures are aware of the zombieâ€™s presence but are so frightened that they never move.

Once a zombie has completed its movement, the first newly created zombie moves using the same sequence
as the original zombie, then the second newly created zombie moves, and so on, in order of infection.
Each zombie performs the same sequence of moves. Once all zombies have completed moving, the final positions of all
zombies and creatures should be output, then the program ends.
